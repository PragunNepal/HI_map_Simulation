# HI Map Simulation
1. Open the Python Notebook File
2. Make the necessary changes - file path, your animation name, among others
3. The simulation is ready to run

The simulation is of 100 frames of redshift value for a grid size of 512^3. The python notebook consists of 2 codes, one with and one without the axes. This simulation basically shows the Epoch of Reionization - HI map.
Since the original code was run on Jupyter Notebook, I recommend to use the same. The rendering time depends from ~5 minutes to ~25 minutes depending on computing power.
